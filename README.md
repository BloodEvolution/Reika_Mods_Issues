# Reika's Mods Issues
The issue tracker for all of my mods - RotaryCraft, its addons, ChromatiCraft, and everything else.


This is now the preferred way of submitting bug reports. Suggestions for new ideas, discussions regarding topics not directly about the mods (eg policies or off-topic) are still best discussed on the forum thread.

Please read the [guidelines](https://github.com/ReikaKalseki/Reika_Mods_Issues/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any bug reports.
