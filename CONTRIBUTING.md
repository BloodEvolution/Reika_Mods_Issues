<b>For issues:</b>

* For all issues: Make sure you are using the latest version! If you are using an old modpack, your version is very likely old and you need to update.

* Read all open issues before you post yours - noone benefits from 160 copies of the same bug report.

* If your issue involves a crash, you <i>must</i> include crash report or a loading log (the former is preferred).
